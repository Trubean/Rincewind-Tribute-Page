    <figcaption id="img-caption">Rincewind was the first protagonist of Discworld; a wizard with no skill, no wizardly qualifications and no interest in heroics. He is the archetypal coward, but is constantly thrust into extremely dangerous adventures and not only manages to stay alive, but also saves Discworld on several occasions, and has an instrumental role in the emergence of life on Roundworld (Science of Discworld) and Discworld itself (Eric)</figcaption>

    <p> - But there are great things for which it is worth giving your life, - objected the Butterfly.</br>
     - No, there are no such cases! Because you have only one life, and great things like dogs uncut!</br>
     - Gods, how can one live with such a philosophy?</br>
    Rincewind took in more air into his chest:</br>
     - Long!</p>
